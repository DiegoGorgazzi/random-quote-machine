This is a challenge project from freeCodeCamp (FCC) which consists in building an app from scratch that returns random quotes.

I've included the original text below with instructions on what they want students to accomplish (copied from: https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine/).

### What I'm probably going to be doing
* Solve the problem the way FCC wants me to solve it.
* After passing all tests, I'll probably replace all ids that I'm forced to use with the classic "className".
* I have some ideas on how to enhance the app.

##  Contributing
The main purpose of this repository is to solve the challenge. I'm not expecting contributions (this isn't a popular topic, after all). However, after the challenge has been completed, I'd love to see what can evolve from here so if you have any ideas/code please share.  

### Code of Conduct
Please keep it professionally clean and friendly. That includes, but is not limited to:
* Being patient. If you get frustrated, step away from the keyboard for a few minutes or hours before you do something you might regret later (if you need a few days, maybe you're in the wrong business?).
* Being all inclusive. We are all people of different age, sex, religion, race, nationality, etc, etc. But, we're all people. Treat people like people and that'll be a good start.

# Front End Libraries Projects - Build a Random Quote Machine
Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/qRZeGZ.
Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.
You can use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery to complete this project. You should use a frontend framework (like React for example) because this section is about learning frontend frameworks. Additional technologies not listed above are not recommended and using them is at your own risk. We are looking at supporting other frontend frameworks like Angular and Vue, but they are not currently supported. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

User Story #1: I can see a wrapper element with a corresponding id="quote-box".

User Story #2: Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="text".

User Story #3: Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="author".

User Story #4: Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding id="new-quote".

User Story #5: Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding id="tweet-quote".

User Story #6: On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with id="text".

User Story #7: On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with id="author".

User Story #8: When the #new-quote button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the #text element.

User Story #9: My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the #new-quote button is clicked and display it in the #author element.

User Story #10: I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the #tweet-quote a element. This a element should include the "twitter.com/intent/tweet" path in it's href attribute to tweet the current quote.

User Story #11: The #quote-box wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.

You can build your project by forking this CodePen pen. Or you can use this CDN link to run the tests in any environment you like: https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js

Once you're done, submit the URL to your working project with all its tests passing.

Remember to use the Read-Search-Ask method if you get stuck.
