This is a challenge project from freeCodeCamp (FCC) which consists in building an App from scratch that returns random quotes.

I've included the original text below with instructions on what they want students to accomplish (copied from: https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine/).

### What I did
* Solved the problem using React following the specs from FCC. Here's the working app: https://random-quote-machine-diego.firebaseapp.com/

### What I'm probably going to be doing after this
* I'll probably replace all ids that I'm forced to use with the classic "className".
* I have some ideas on how to enhance the app (dynamically adding quotes via input and/or fetching from a server, filtering quotes by category, adding animations, transitions, pictures, more social media favicons, etc, etc.).
* Hard coding the quotes was a pain in the neck. I look forward tackling that problem but it will probably require authentication (which If I want to do it right, will require Routing), so it's going to take a little while. Don't hold your breath.
* I'll probably either create a release, another branch, or something so keep the FCC version separated from the enhanced version.


##  Contributing
The main purpose of this repository was to solve the challenge and share my solution. I'm not expecting contributions (this isn't a popular topic, after all). However, I'd love to see what can evolve from here so if you have any ideas/code please share. Also, if you have comments on the code I wrote I'd love to hear from you as well. I'll take all criticism as constructive (but try to be nice!).  

### Code of Conduct
Please keep it professionally clean and friendly. That includes, but is not limited to:
* Being patient. If you get frustrated, step away from the keyboard for a few minutes or hours before you do something you might regret later (if you need a few days, maybe you're in the wrong business?).
* Being all inclusive. We are all people of different age, sex, religion, race, nationality, etc, etc. But, we're all people. Treat people like people and that'll be a good start.

### Time is of the Essence
* Time is always precious. There's always another project in the pipeline that needs (or would be nice) to be done and applying improvements to past projects is always a challenge (especially since they are unpaid! :laughing:). Still, I'll do my best to come back to this. If you contribute and I don't reply right away please accept my apologies in advance but know your contribution is important and I will reply as soon as possible.

# Front End Libraries Projects - Build a Random Quote Machine
Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/qRZeGZ.
Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.
You can use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery to complete this project. You should use a frontend framework (like React for example) because this section is about learning frontend frameworks. Additional technologies not listed above are not recommended and using them is at your own risk. We are looking at supporting other frontend frameworks like Angular and Vue, but they are not currently supported. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

User Story #1: I can see a wrapper element with a corresponding id="quote-box".

User Story #2: Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="text".

User Story #3: Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="author".

User Story #4: Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding id="new-quote".

User Story #5: Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding id="tweet-quote".

User Story #6: On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with id="text".

User Story #7: On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with id="author".

User Story #8: When the #new-quote button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the #text element.

User Story #9: My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the #new-quote button is clicked and display it in the #author element.

User Story #10: I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the #tweet-quote a element. This a element should include the "twitter.com/intent/tweet" path in it's href attribute to tweet the current quote.

User Story #11: The #quote-box wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.

You can build your project by forking this CodePen pen. Or you can use this CDN link to run the tests in any environment you like: https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js

Once you're done, submit the URL to your working project with all its tests passing.

Remember to use the Read-Search-Ask method if you get stuck.
